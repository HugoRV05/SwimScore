For scoring purposes, only two swimmers per club, category, and gender will be considered.

• The first sixteen finishers in each event and category (14u, junior, and senior) will score points, provided they meet the minimum qualifying time required for their age group.

• If a club has more than two swimmers among the top sixteen in the same event, only the first two will score points, and the corresponding points will be allocated to the remaining swimmers who are not from the same club.

• The first sixteen teams in each relay event will score points, in both the men's and women's senior categories. • The scoring for individual events will be: 19, 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points.

• The scoring for relay events will be: 38, 32, 28, 26, 24, 22, 20, 18,
16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 points. Except for the 4x200 relay, which will be 7, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, and 1 point.

• The best regional times for the age groups corresponding to the competition categories, the absolute championship records, and the absolute regional records established or broken during this competition, regardless of the finishing position, will receive an additional 5, 10, and 15 points, respectively. The best national times will receive an extra 25 points.

• The first leg in relay events (provided the relay is not mixed) may count as a championship record, a best regional time, or an absolute record if one is established.

• In the event of a tie, and provided the swimmers are eligible to score, the points to be awarded will be totaled and divided by the number of tied swimmers. The result of this calculation will determine the number of points awarded to each swimmer. A similar procedure will be followed if
the tied teams are relay teams.
All swimmers will be able to score points in the senior category, in addition to their own.
